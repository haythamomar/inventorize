Description: facilitate  inventory analysis calculations.the package heavily relies on my studies,
  especially the MIT micro masters program for supply chain lead by Prof. Chris Caplice.
  the package includes calculations of inventory metrics, profit calculations and ABC analysis calculations.
  the first version has only normal and Poisson distributions but I am hoping that other distributions will follow in later versions..
